import TextBuffer

/// Branching paths where optional unwrapping happens lazily during evaluation time.
///
/// Since we don't have `if let` support from the Result Builder, ``IfLet`` is added for consistency to express unwrapping in the DSL.
///
/// ## Motivation for an ``IfLet`` type in spite of Swift Result Builder's capabilities
///
/// If you think of ``Buffer/evaluate(_:)-7jmtt`` as the "run time", Swift Result Builder's `buildOptional` and `buildEither` check their condition at "compile time". That means you cannot form conditions on ``AffectedRange``.
///
/// This is a confusing limitation, and brings with it potentially dangerous (as in: crashing) situations.
///
/// > Further Reading: For a detailed explanation of the "runtime" and "build time" concepts, or to learn more about how to think about Swift Result Builders, see <doc:Runtime>.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// Appends an optional string to the buffer if it's non-nil.
///
/// ```swift
/// var optionalValue: String? = ...
/// try buffer.evaluate { fullRange in
///     IfLet (optionalValue) { value in
///         Modifying(fullRange) {
///             Insert($0.endLocation) { value }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
