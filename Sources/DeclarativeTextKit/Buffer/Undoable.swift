import Foundation

/// Decorator of any ``Buffer`` to add undo/redo functionality through Foundation's `UndoManager`.
///
/// ## How Undo Grouping Works
///
/// All direct mutations are wrapped in `beginUndoGrouping()`/`endUndoGrouping()` calls, so any deletion's and insertion's inverse action is added to the undo stack.
///
/// To group multiple buffer mutations in a single undo group, e.g. to delete parts of text in multiple places as one action, you can either
/// - use the ``Modifying-struct`` command from the DSL, which wraps its mutations in an undo group when applied to an ``Undoable`` buffer, or
/// - use the ``undoGrouping(actionName:_:)`` function directly.
///
/// ## Caveats and Pitfalls
///
/// You need to make sure that the ``Undoable`` instance stays in memory (there's at least 1 strong reference) for undoing to work, especially if you register with the "global" undo manager of the current window.
///
/// Conversely, you can't treat ``Undoable`` instances as lightweight wrappers that you throw away after use. That would effectively remove all undoable actions.
///
/// **Reason:** ``Undoable`` removes all undo groups from its ``undoManager`` upon deinitialization. If you've ever worked with the block-based `UndoManager.registerUndo(withTarget:handler:)`, you know that the `target` parameter is not retained. It's an unowned reference. We can't keep the undoable action on the undo stack when the target, your ``Undoable`` buffer, is gone. It cleans up after itself to avoid crashes.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// It's up to you and your requirements if you want hold on to the original, non-undoable buffer, or wrap it in ``Undoable`` and then the resulting object instead.
///
/// This example demonstrates how a regular buffer is decorated with undo support and how the original is still perfectly usable:
///
/// ```swift
/// let buffer: Buffer = MutableStringBuffer("")
/// print(buffer) // => ""
///
/// let undoable = Undoable(buffer)
///
/// // Combine changes into one operation:
/// undoable.undoGrouping {
///     undoable.insert("World", at: 0)
///     undoable.insert("Hello, ", at: 0)
/// }
/// print(buffer) // => "Hello, World"
///
/// undoable.undo()
/// print(buffer) // => ""
///
/// undoable.redo()
/// print(buffer) // => "Hello, World"
/// ```
